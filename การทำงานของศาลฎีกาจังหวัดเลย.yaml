'''[https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/notes/privatenotespage Jimdo GmbH]''' is a German [[website]] builder privately held and headquartered in [[Hamburg, Germany]], with offices in [[Munich]] and [[Tokyo]]. The software is aimed at small and medium businesses, providing tools to create e-commerce websites, gather analytics and automate SEO.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jimdo Review 2025: Fast, Simple, But Is It Really Worth It? |url=https://litextension.com/blog/jimdo-review/ |access-date=2025-09-11 |language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==
Jimdo was founded in 2007 by Matthias Henze, Christian Springub and Fridtjof Detzner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tech.eu/features/4245/jimdo-profile/|title=Jimdo: profitable since 2009, 12m sites, only €500,000 raised|date=2015-03-26|website=Tech.eu|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>

While they were still in high school, Springub and Detzner started their first internet agency, designing websites for small businesses in [[Cuxhaven|Cuxhaven, Germany]]. When Matthias Henze joined the company in 2004, the team decided to build their own content management system, which would go on to become Jimdo in 2007.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/work-smarter-what-ive-learned-jimdo|title=How Jimdo went from tech spinoff to major startup success|last=Stokel-Walker|first=Chris|date=2018-08-23|magazine=Wired UK|access-date=2019-10-23|issn=1357-0978}}</ref>

In April 2009, after [[Yahoo!]] announced that [[GeoCities]] was closing, Jimdo announced that former GeoCities users were welcome on Jimdo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2241092/yahoo-closing-geocities|title=Yahoo closing Geocities web hosting service - vnunet.com|date=2009-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426073628/http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2241092/yahoo-closing-geocities|access-date=2019-10-23|archive-date=26 April 2009}}</ref> Jimdo started the "Lifeboat for GeoCities" promotion to help users transition to Jimdo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jimdo.com/2009/04/23/jimdo-s-lifeboat-for-geocities/|title=Jimdo's Lifeboat for GeoCities - Jimdo|date=2009-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503033115/http://www.jimdo.com/2009/04/23/jimdo-s-lifeboat-for-geocities/|access-date=2019-10-23|archive-date=3 May 2009}}</ref> Jimdo offered a ten percent discount to users who moved from GeoCities and [[Google Page Creator]] to Jimdo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mmthomasblog.com/jimdo-review/|title=Jimdo Review 2019|date=2019-04-10|website=MM Thomas Blog|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>

In 2010, Jimdo added a "store" service that allows Jimdo website owners to conduct electronic commerce services.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/02/28/AR2010022801979.html|title=Jimdo Makes Running Your Own Online Store A Breeze, Loses Investor|last=Wauters|first=Robin|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=2010-02-28|access-date=2019-10-23|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> Also in 2010, United Internet withdrew from the company's board.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/28/jimdo-store/|title=Jimdo Makes Running Your Own Online Store A Breeze, Loses Investor|website=TechCrunch|date=28 February 2010 |access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref> In February 2012, the 5 millionth Jimdo site went online<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.homepage-baukasten.com/jimdo-feiert-baukasten-5-millionen-websites-in-5-jahren.html|title=Jimdo mit 5 Millionen Websites in 5 Jahren - Happy Birthday|website=www.homepage-baukasten.com|access-date=2019-10-23|archive-date=1 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301203951/http://www.homepage-baukasten.com/jimdo-feiert-baukasten-5-millionen-websites-in-5-jahren.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> and in November 2013, the 10 millionth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apfellike.com/2013/11/shortnews-jimdo-zaehlt-10-millionen-websiten/|title=Shortnews: Jimdo zählt 10 Millionen Websiten|last=pages/Jrgen-Ulbrich/480818298706601|date=2013-11-12|website=Apfellike.com|language=de|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref> As of July 2019, over 25 million websites have been created with Jimdo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://careers.jimdo.com/|title=About us|website=Jimdo GmbH|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>

On June 8, 2015, Jimdo secured 25 million euros worth of investment from the American company Spectrum Equity. With this investment, Spectrum Equity now holds a share of 26.7 percent of Jimdo GmbH<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://website-tutor.com/25-millionen-fuer-jimdo/|title=Homepage-Baukasten Jimdo will an die Spitze|date=2015-06-09|website=Website Tutor|language=de-DE|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref> although the company remains privately held. In October 2016, Jimdo laid off 25% of its staff in a bid to regain focus after founders recognized that the company was getting slower at product development. Co-founder, Henze, described the decision as Jimdo's "most difficult moment".<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/work-smarter-what-ive-learned-jimdo|title=How Jimdo went from tech spinoff to major startup success|last=Stokel-Walker|first=Chris|date=2018-08-23|magazine=Wired UK|access-date=2019-10-23|issn=1357-0978}}</ref>

In 2017, Jimdo launched its new artificially intelligent website builder, Jimdo Dolphin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jimdo.com/blog/jimdo-dolphin-newest-way-to-build-a-website/|title=Jimdo Dolphin: A Preview Release of a New Generation of Website-Builder|last=Henze|first=Matthias|date=2017-10-17|website=The Jimdo blog for entrepreneurs|access-date=2019-10-23|archive-date=23 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191023134039/https://www.jimdo.com/blog/jimdo-dolphin-newest-way-to-build-a-website/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The new AI-powered product enables users with basic computer skills to build their websites.

On its release, Jimdo's CEO and co-founder, Matthias Henze, said the company had seen "an opportunity to make website creation radically easier",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisoncoleman/2018/06/28/jimdo-the-website-builder-for-entrepreneurs-that-owns-easy/|title=Lessons in Scaling A Startup: The Founder of Jimdo on His Quest For Startup Agility|last=Coleman|first=Alison|website=Forbes|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref> describing Dolphin as "a new kind of website builder that asks you brief questions about your business, and then creates a totally personalized website with text, photos, and other details already filled in".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jimdo.com/blog/jimdo-dolphin-newest-way-to-build-a-website/|title=Jimdo Dolphin: A Preview Release of a New Generation of Website-Builder|last=Henze|first=Matthias|date=2017-10-17|website=The Jimdo blog for entrepreneurs|access-date=2019-10-23|archive-date=23 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191023134039/https://www.jimdo.com/blog/jimdo-dolphin-newest-way-to-build-a-website/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Dolphin users are guided through the website creation process by a wizard, which prompts them to answer questions about the purpose and goals of their website.

Dolphin then builds a personalized website complete with texts and images tailored to the user's industry and specific goals. Once their website is created, users can choose to use the integrated Assistant to guide them through each step of the website building process and learn to use features like Dolphin's automatic SEO.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jimdo.com/blog/smart-seo-does-the-hard-work/|title=New Dolphin SEO Does the Hard Work For You {{!}} Jimdo|last=Henze|first=Matthias|date=2018-05-18|website=The Jimdo blog for entrepreneurs|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>

=== Jimdo Dolphin Reviews ===
In December 2018, Robert Brandl from WebToolTester.com reported "impressive" results with Jimdo Dolphin, "You can actually create the first draft [of your website] in just 3 minutes [...] If you're prepared to invest another hour or two into customizing the text and adding further subpages, the final product can be made to look really impressive". But describes the "basic level of SEO optimization" as "disappointing as it stands".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.websitetooltester.com/en/blog/jimdo-dolphin/|title=Jimdo Dolphin: The Pros and Cons of an Intelligent Website Builder|date=2018-10-30|website=WebsiteToolTester|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>

In February 2019, Chris Singleton from Style Factory gave Jimdo 3/5 stars, "It's well-suited to small businesses that require a simple online presence and/or shop, but don't have the budget, expertise or time to grapple with more complex systems".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stylefactoryproductions.com/blog/jimdo-review|title=Jimdo Review (2019) - The 12 Big Things You Need to Know|website=Style Factory|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>

In October 2019, Hendrick Human from WebsitePlanet.com rated Jimdo 4.7/5 stars, "If you're new to building websites and all you want is a simple website with a blog or online store and decent SEO, then it's not a bad option. If you have bigger plans for your site, there's a good chance you'll find Jimdo [Dolphin] too restrictive".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.websiteplanet.com/website-builders/jimdo/|title=Jimdo Review 2019 – Not Bad, But We've Seen Better!|date=2018-04-13|website=Website Planet|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>

=== Online Store ===
In February 2019, Jimdo added an online "store" to its new website builder, Dolphin, to let users shop via electronic commerce. The drag-and-drop style is suitable for users without any technical knowledge who want to sell products online. Users can choose to receive payments via SEPA Direct Debit, credit card, or PayPal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jimdo.com/pricing/|title=Pricing|website=www.jimdo.com|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>

"The top two [Jimdo Dolphin subscription] plans make it easy to start an e-commerce store. You just start adding products. Both plans allow you to add as many as you like, but the eCommerce plan is limited in that you only have 50 pages to work with. You can take payments using SEPA Direct Debit, PayPal, or credit card. And unlike some e-commerce website builders, Jimdo does not take a cut of your sells", said Frank Moraes from HTML.com.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://html.com/web-hosting/jimdo/|title=Jimdo Review: Does This Website Builder Really Make Web Design Easy?|date=2018-08-20|website=html.com|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>

Dolphin's premium plans include a free domain for the first year, email features, extra storage and bandwidth, more responsive customer support, access to the Jimdo Boost and Jimdo Live Chat apps, additional website pages, and no advertisements.

==Reception==
Two months after the service launch in 2007, Rafe Needleman of [[CNet]] gave a positive review to Jimdo. Needleman described Jimdo as a "good service for creating a quick site to document a trip or other event, or to prototype a simple personal or business site." He also said that Jimdo was not "mature enough yet" for use by a United States-based small business, "but it's worth keeping track of.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/jimdo-another-super-simple-site-builder/|title=Jimdo: Another super-simple site builder|last=Needleman|first=Rafe|website=CNET|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>" In 2010, [[VentureBeat]] reported on the opening of the US office in San Francisco and the launch of an online store feature, concluding "US readers will probably hear more about the company in the coming months".

In 2012, David Pogue cited Jimdo in The New York Times, as a recommended replacement for the website building feature in [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] [[MobileMe]] service, following Apple's decision to shut down the service on 30 June 2012. Reasoning that "Jimdo's design templates are better looking [than Weebly's], and the paid plan offers more advanced features. You can even sell stuff from your Jimdo site".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/07/technology/personaltech/goodbye-mobileme-hello-smugmug-dropbox-and-jimdo-state-of-the-art.html|title=Goodbye, MobileMe.

In 2013, USA Today commended Jimdo for "how easily it handles e-commerce" and its "ease of use", recommending it for small business owners who would be "unlikely to find a simpler solution".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2013/09/22/free-website-build-tumblr-weebly-jimdo-wordpress/2838269/|title=TECH NOW: How to make your own website for free|website=USA TODAY|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>

In June 2018, following the release of Jimdo's new AI-driven website builder, Dolphin, Forbes writer Alison Coleman hailed the service as an alternative to "traditional website builders" that have "become extremely powerful and able to create extremely sophisticated results, but for most people, they still take too long and involve a steep learning curve". In contrast, Jimdo Dolphin "pulls everything together quickly, and their online content is ready and waiting. From there [Dolphin] provides further support, for example, handling some of the SEO tasks".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisoncoleman/2018/06/28/jimdo-the-website-builder-for-entrepreneurs-that-owns-easy/|title=Lessons in Scaling A Startup: The Founder of Jimdo on His Quest For Startup Agility|last=Coleman|first=Alison|website=Forbes|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref>
