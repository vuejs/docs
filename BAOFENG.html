<description>Hello people, I've been using Eddie - AirVPN for months now, on Windows 11 that is. Since about a week or so I've been running into a very annoying issue. Without exception, I had to reinstall the client every day of the week. I would install the VPN, connect to my preferred server and when done using it, I would disconnect and then exit the application. After shutting down or rebooting the PC, the next time it's turned on the VPN doesn't work anymore. I get a handshake timeout and it tries (and fails) again, each and every time. The only working solution I have is to fully reinstall the VPN with software like BcUninstaller or Revo Uninstaller (which delete user folders of applications as well) to get it working again after a reinstall. I have no issues with any other network adapters on the device or on other devices, i've checked my DNS settings as well which are fine too. Having to reinstall the VPN each and every time I turn on my PC gets boring quite quick. I would like to know if there's anything I could try to fix this, I tried manually setting protocols and disabling network lock, neither of which seemed to bring me any luck. If necessary I can send my logs, but for now it's next to empty as I have just reinstalled the application. So I can provide that in a while. Thank you in advance!</description>

<title>Suspicious files related to Eddie</title>

<description>Hello, friends. I am investigating an intrusion. Some anti-rootkit solutions for Linux mention that these files from hybrid-analysis are suspicious. However, when I analyze them in VirusTotal, the name “Eddie” appears. Does this mean that it is related to the Eddie client, or should I investigate further? Thank you very much for responding to my security concerns! 1. https://hybrid-analysis.com/sample/2d877bed6f13810bc024cb5d53651d2c792f2047e1e2ccb6cea58b67460d418e 2. https://hybrid-analysis.com/sample/80a0e1625ed38e108e70708d119b58c8a3e94c448557922faaa6476830fd3739 3. https://hybrid-analysis.com/sample/9f33b6fa29396ef1e46082238076e61ef0064892dd84f008608abd09fa48b20a --</description>

<title>DNS Leak on Mac with Wireguard</title>
<link>
<![CDATA[ https://airvpn.org/forums/topic/76004-dns-leak-on-mac-with-wireguard/?do=findComment&comment=256307 ]]>

<description>I recently bought a new Mac and rather than restoring from a backup as I normally do, I thought I'd set everything up fresh and have a clean to start to everything. I was surprised to see that after installing the official Wireguard client and creating a config through the AVPN config generator that IPLeak reported by machine using my ISP's DNS. Wireguard was using the VPN servers IP addresses correctly. Similar happens at home, where IPLeak shows my DNS as being managed by Cloudflare, which is what I have my router set to use as a default rather than my ISP's DNS. I know this isn't a problem if I use Eddie, but I love the basic simplicity of the Wireguard app and would prefer to install as few applications as possible now I'm on a clean setup. If anyone can offer a suggestion to force my Mac to always use AirVPN's internal DNS that'd be really appreciated. Thanks. EDIT: I checked Wireguard's tunnel manager when the VPN was active and it shows the DNS being used is '10.128.0.1', which I believe is correct, but that's not what IPLeak sees. Presumably my Mac is ignoring that and defaulting to the default DNS.</description>

<description>Hi there! I tried connecting to https://fitgirl-repacks.site/, however, was unable to. To verify this was not an issue with my connection, I checked the Routing page... https://airvpn.org/routes/?q=https%3A%2F%2Ffitgirl-repacks.site%2F ...And as you can see a lot of issues with the servers. This is my first time posting, apologies if this is not the right formatting.</description>

<title>Packet Loss on all central european servers</title>
<link>
<![CDATA[ https://airvpn.org/forums/topic/75933-packet-loss-on-all-central-european-servers/?do=findComment&comment=256211 ]]>

<description>Since a while I experience Packet Loss on the AirVPN Network. Lately it has gotten worse. What happens? I have approximately 5-20% packet loss on all - Frankfurt - Berlin - Swiss and partially also on Netherlands servers. This packet loss is constant and reproduceable from my end. When I connect to Norway packet loss is gone and I have a stable connection with an very acceptable packet loss of 0.00-0.02% - which I deem normal. Logs Connected to Camelopardalis Norway (all good) Connected to Ogma Germany Conclusio I write you here, because from my end it looks like AirVPN is the problem. If I choose a different exit node the packet loss is completely gone. Those servers close to my location all have this problem. Do I have outdated configs? Do some settings missmatch? How do i check this? Is there a way to narrow down the problem? When does the Packet loss occur - on the way to the exit node or behind the exit node?</description>

<description>Had to reinstall my OS (After a complete Reformat) And Sadly nothing was back up After a fresh install of WIn 11 Pro - Now I am unable to connect to any server. Please see attached logs. Edit: NVM - I Immediately figured it out, I had an ethernet cable plugged in, and I guess it was trying to use my Ethernet connection, instead of my Wifi Connection. Not sure why my ethernet is NOT working, but issue resolved. Eddie_20251006_215854.txt</description>
