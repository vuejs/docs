## Contributing

This site is built with [VitePress](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress) and depends on [@vue/theme](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-theme). Site content is written in Markdown format located in `src`. For simple edits, you can directly edit the file on GitHub and generate a Pull Request.

For local development, [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is preferred as package manager:

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```
