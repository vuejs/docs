# Suspense {#suspense}

:::warning Experimental Feature
`<Suspense>` is an experimental feature. It is not guaranteed to reach stable status and the API may change before it does.
:::

`<Suspense>` is a built-in component for orchestrating async dependencies in a component tree. It can render a loading state while waiting for multiple nested async dependencies down the component tree to be resolved.

## Async Dependencies {#async-dependencies}

To explain the problem `<Suspense>` is trying to solve and how it interacts with these async dependencies, let's imagine a component hierarchy like the following:

```
<Suspense>
└─ <Dashboard>
   ├─ <Profile>
   │  └─ <FriendStatus> (component with async setup())
   └─ <Content>
      ├─ <ActivityFeed> (async component)
      └─ <Stats> (async component)
```

In the component tree there are multiple nested components whose rendering depends on some async resource to be resolved first. Without `<Suspense>`, each of them will need to handle its own loading / error and loaded states. In the worst case scenario, we may see three loading spinners on the page, with content displayed at different times.

The `<Suspense>` component gives us the ability to display top-level loading / error states while we wait on these nested async dependencies to be resolved.

There are two types of async dependencies that `<Suspense>` can wait on:

1. Components with an async `setup()` hook. This includes components using `<script setup>` with top-level `await` expressions.

2. [Async Components](/guide/components/async).

### `async setup()` {#async-setup}

A Composition API component's `setup()` hook can be async:

```js
export default {
  async setup() {
    const res = await fetch(...)
    const posts = await res.json()
    return {
      posts
    }
  }
}
```

If using `<script setup>`, the presence of top-level `await` expressions automatically makes the component an async dependency:

```vue
<script setup>
const res = await fetch(...)
const posts = await res.json()
</script>

<template>
  {{ posts }}
</template>
```

### Async Components {#async-components}

Async components are **"suspensible"** by default. This means that if it has a `<Suspense>` in the parent chain, it will be treated as an async dependency of that `<Suspense>`. In this case, the loading state will be controlled by the `<Suspense>`, and the component's own loading, error, delay and timeout options will be ignored.

The async component can opt-out of `Suspense` control and let the component always control its own loading state by specifying `suspensible: false` in its options.

## Loading State {#loading-state}

The `<Suspense>` component has two slots: `#default` and `#fallback`. Both slots only allow for **one** immediate child node. The node in the default slot is shown if possible. If not, the node in the fallback slot will be shown instead.

```vue-html
<Suspense>
  <!-- component with nested async dependencies -->
  <Dashboard />

  <!-- loading state via #fallback slot -->
  <template #fallback>
    Loading...
  </template>
</Suspense>
```

On initial render, `<Suspense>` will render its default slot content in memory. If any async dependencies are encountered during the process, it will enter a **pending** state. During the pending state, the fallback content will be displayed. When all encountered async dependencies have been resolved, `<Suspense>` enters a **resolved** state and the resolved default slot content is displayed.

If no async dependencies were encountered during the initial render, `<Suspense>` will directly go into a resolved state.

Once in a resolved state, `<Suspense>` will only revert to a pending state if the root node of the `#default` slot is replaced. New async dependencies nested deeper in the tree will **not** cause the `<Suspense>` to revert to a pending state.

When a revert happens, fallback content will not be immediately displayed. Instead, `<Suspense>` will display the previous `#default` content while waiting for the new content and its async dependencies to be resolved. This behavior can be configured with the `timeout` prop: `<Suspense>` will switch to fallback content if it takes longer than `timeout` to render the new default content. A `timeout` value of `0` will cause the fallback content to be displayed immediately when default content is replaced.

## Events {#events}

The `<Suspense>` component emits 3 events: `pending`, `resolve` and `fallback`. The `pending` event occurs when entering a pending state. The `resolve` event is emitted when new content has finished resolving in the `default` slot. The `fallback` event is fired when the contents of the `fallback` slot are shown.

The events could be used, for example, to show a loading indicator in front of the old DOM while new components are loading.

## Error Handling {#error-handling}

`<Suspense>` currently does not provide error handling via the component itself - however, you can use the [`errorCaptured`](/api/options-lifecycle#errorcaptured) option or the [`onErrorCaptured()`](/api/composition-api-lifecycle#onerrorcaptured) hook to capture and handle async errors in the parent component of `<Suspense>`.

## Combining with Other Components {#combining-with-other-components}

It is common to want to use `<Suspense>` in combination with the [`<Transition>`](./transition) and [`<KeepAlive>`](./keep-alive) components. The nesting order of these components is important to get them all working correctly.

In addition, these components are often used in conjunction with the `<RouterView>` component from [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/).

The following example shows how to nest these components so that they all behave as expected. For simpler combinations you can remove the components that you don't need:

```vue-html
<RouterView v-slot="{ Component }">
  <template v-if="Component">
    <Transition mode="out-in">
      <KeepAlive>
        <Suspense>
          <!-- main content -->
          <component :is="Component"></component>

          <!-- loading state -->
          <template #fallback>
            Loading...
          </template>
        </Suspense>
      </KeepAlive>
    </Transition>
  </template>
</RouterView>
```

Vue Router has built-in support for [lazily loading components](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/lazy-loading.html) using dynamic imports. These are distinct from async components and currently they will not trigger `<Suspense>`. However, they can still have async components as descendants and those can trigger `<Suspense>` in the usual way.

## Nested Suspense {#nested-suspense}

- Only supported in 3.3+

When we have multiple async components (common for nested or layout-based routes) like this:

```vue-html
<Suspense>
  <component :is="DynamicAsyncOuter">
    <component :is="DynamicAsyncInner" />
  </component>
</Suspense>
```

`<Suspense>` creates a boundary that will resolve all the async components down the tree, as expected. However, when we change `DynamicAsyncOuter`, `<Suspense>` awaits it correctly, but when we change `DynamicAsyncInner`, the nested `DynamicAsyncInner` renders an empty node until it has been resolved (instead of the previous one or fallback slot).

In order to solve that, we could have a nested suspense to handle the patch for the nested component, like:

```vue-html
<Suspense>
  <component :is="DynamicAsyncOuter">
    <Suspense suspensible> <!-- this -->
      <component :is="DynamicAsyncInner" />
    </Suspense>
  </component>
</Suspense>
```

If you don't set the `suspensible` prop, the inner `<Suspense>` will be treated like a sync component by the parent `<Suspense>`. That means that it has its own fallback slot and if both `Dynamic` components change at the same time, there might be empty nodes and multiple patching cycles while the child `<Suspense>` is loading its own dependency tree, which might not be desirable. When it's set, all the async dependency handling is given to the parent `<Suspense>` (including the events emitted) and the inner `<Suspense>` serves solely as another boundary for the dependency resolution and patching.
