Now you can accept or deny incoming, outgoing or both ICMP-echo packets, and independently you can permit or forbid IPv6 NDP, which is based on ICMPv6. The new options supported by Hummingbird (please check the readme file for additional details) are: --allow-ping --allow-ipv6ndp Apple ARM based systems version is now C++20 compliant (required by Sequoia) Important note for high speed line users Because of some architectural specifications and implementation in macOS Hummingbird may warn the user about shortage of buffer space, specifically when connected with the UDP. This condition is signaled by Hummingbird with the below messages in the log: UDP send exception: send: No buffer space available ERROR: NETWORK_SEND_ERROR The error is caused by the maximum network sockets size set in macOS, a value usually small and unsuited for modern high speed networks. The solution consists in increasing the maximum allowed size for socket buffers and, in case the problem persists, the number of mbuf clusters. The procedure is simple, please find out all the details in the manual. Open the README.md file with any viewer and consult the "Note on macOS and UDP" section.

<description>
<![CDATA[ Hello! We're very glad to announce that AirVPN Suite 2.0.0 Release is available. Special thanks to the outstanding community beta testers whose continued support in over a year and a half has been invaluable and decisive to find out and address several, insidious bugs. AirVPN Suite 2.0.0 introduces AirVPN's exclusive per app traffic splitting system, bug fixes, revised code, WireGuard support, and the latest OpenVPN3-AirVPN 3.12 library. Please see the respective changelogs for a complete list of changes for each component of the suite. The 2.0.0 Suite includes: Bluetit: lightweight, ultra-fast D-Bus controlled system daemon providing full connectivity and integration to AirVPN servers, or generic OpenVPN and WireGuard servers. Bluetit can also enforce Network Lock and/or connect the system to AirVPN during the bootstrap Goldcrest: Bluetit client, allowing full integration with AirVPN servers, users, keys, profiles as well as generic OpenVPN and WireGuard servers Hummingbird: lightweight and standalone binary for generic OpenVPN and WireGuard server connections Cuckoo: traffic split manager, granting full access and functionality to AirVPN's traffic split infrastructure airsu: a "run and forget" tool to automatically set and enable the user environment for the X.Org or Wayland based ecosystem without any user input WireGuard support WireGuard support is now available in Bluetit and Hummingbird. OpenVPN or WireGuard selection is controlled by Bluetit run control file option airvpntype or by Goldcrest option -f (short for --air-vpn-type). Possible values: openvpn, wireguard. New 2.0.0 default: wireguard. Bluetit run control file (/etc/airvpn/bluetit.rc) option: airvpntype: (string) VPN type to be used for AirVPN connections. Possible values: wireguard, openvpn. Default: wireguard Goldcrest option: --air-vpn-type, -f : VPN type for AirVPN connection &lt;wireguard|openvpn&gt; Suspend and resume services for systemd based systems For your comfort, the installation script can create suspend and resume services in systemd based systems, according to your preferences. allowing a more proper management of VPN connections when the system is suspended and resumed. The network connection detection code has also been rewritten to provide more appropriate behavior. Asynchronous mode A new asynchronous mode (off by default) is supported by Bluetit and Goldcrest, allowing asynchronous connections. Network Lock can be used accordingly in asynchronous connections. Please consult the readme.md file included in every tarball for more information and details. Word completion on bash and zsh Auto completion is now available by pressing the TAB key when entering any Goldcrest or Hummingbird option and filename on a bash or zsh interpreter. Auto completion files are installed automatically by the installation script. AirVPN's VPN traffic splitting AirVPN Suite version 2.0.0 introduces traffic splitting by using a dedicated network namespace. The VPN traffic is carried out in the default (main) namespace, ensuring all system data and traffic to be encrypted into the VPN tunnel by default. No clear and unencrypted data are allowed to pass through the default namespace. Any non-tunneled network traffic must be explicitly requested by an authorized user with the right to run cuckoo, the AirVPN traffic split manager tool. AirVPN's traffic splitting is managed by Bluetit and configured through run control directives. The system has been created in order to minimize any tedious or extensive configuration, even to the minimal point of telling Bluetit to enable traffic splitting with no other setting. In order to enable and control AirVPN's traffic splitting, the below new run control directives for /etc/airvpn/bluetit.rc have been implemented: allowtrafficsplitting: (on/off) enable or disable traffic splitting. Default: off trafficsplitnamespace: (string) name of Linux network namespace dedicated to traffic splitting. Default: aircuckoo trafficsplitinterface: (string) name of the physical network interface to be used for traffic splitting. All the unencrypted and out of the tunnel data will pass through the specified network device/interface. In case this directive is not used and unspecified, Bluetit will automatically use the main network interface of the system and connected to the default gateway. Default: unspecified trafficsplitnamespaceinterface: (string) name of the virtual network interface to be associated to the Linux network namespace dedicated to traffic splitting. Default: ckveth0 trafficsplitipv4: (IPv4 address|auto) IPv4 address of the virtual network interface used for traffic splitting. In case it is set to 'auto', Bluetit will try to automatically assign an unused IPv4 address belonging to the system's host sub-network (/24) Default: auto trafficsplitipv6: (IPv6 address|auto) IPv6 address of the virtual network interface used for traffic splitting. In case it is set to 'auto', Bluetit will try to automatically assign an unused IPv6 address belonging to the system's host sub-network (/64) Default: auto trafficsplitfirewall: (on/off) enable or disable the firewall in Linux network namespace dedicated to traffic splitting. The firewall is set up with a minimal rule set for a very basic security model. Default: off AirVPN's traffic splitting is designed in order to minimize any further configuration from the system administrator. To actually enable traffic splitting, it is just needed to set "allowtrafficsplitting" directive to "on" and Bluetit will configure the traffic split namespace with the default options as explained above. When needed, the system administrator can finely tune the traffic splitting service by using the above directives. Power and limitations The adopted solution offers a remarkable security bonus in terms of isolation. For example, it gets rid of the dangerous DNS "leaks in" typical of cgroups based traffic splitting solutions. However, the dedicated namespace needs an exclusive IP address. If the system is behind a NAT (connected to a home router for example) this is not a problem, but if the system is not behind any NAT, i.e. it is assigned directly a public IP address, you will need another public IP address for the network namespace dedicated to traffic splitting. You will need to manually set the other public IP address on the trafficsplitipv4 or trafficsplitipv6 directive as the guessing abilities of Bluetit may work only within a private subnet. Please keep this limitation in mind especially if you want to run the Suite with per app traffic splitting on a dedicated or virtual server in some datacenter, as they are most of the times NOT behind any NAT. Introducing Cuckoo, the AirVPN traffic splitting manager tool To generate out of the tunnel traffic, any application software must be run inside the "traffic split" namespace by using the dedicated traffic split tool cuckoo which can be run by users belonging to the airvpn group only. It cannot be used by the superuser. The usage is documented in the manual and on the inline help. The traffic split namespace uses its own routing, network channels and system DNS. It will not interfere or communicate in any way with the default namespace using its own encrypted tunnel. Programs started with cuckoo are regular Linux processes and, as such, can be managed (stopped, interrupted, paused, terminated and killed) by using the usual process control tools. The programs started by cuckoo are assigned to the user who started cuckoo. As a final note, in order to work properly, the following permissions must be granted to cuckoo and they are always checked at each run. Owner: root Group: airvpn Permissions: -rwsr-xr-x (owner can read, write, execute and setuid; group can read and execute, others can read and execute) Special note for snap packages users Snap is a controversial, locking-in package management system developed by Canonical and praised by Microsoft. It packages applications as snaps, which are self-contained units that include all necessary dependencies and run in a sandboxed environment in its default namespace. Therefore, "snap" applications will bypass the order by the system via Cuckoo to have an application running in one specific namespace created for reverse traffic splitting. As a result, snap applications will jettison the Suite's reverse traffic splitting feature. Currently, you must avoid snap packages of those applications whose traffic must flow outside the VPN tunnel. The issue is particularly relevant ever since Ubuntu migrated certain packages exclusively to Snap, such as Chromium and Firefox. At the moment it is still possible to eradicate snap from various distributions, including Ubuntu, quickly. Special note for firewalld users Please read here, it's very important: https://airvpn.org/forums/topic/70164-linux-network-lock-and-firewalld/ AirVPN Switch User Tool Airsu Running an application in a graphical environment requires a user having a local environment properly set, in particular variables and access to specific sockets or cookies. They are usually set at the moment of graphical login, while they may not be properly set in case a user logged in by using the system tool su. In this specific case the user will not probably be allowed to access the graphical environment, so any GUI application will not start. AirVPN’s airsu is used for this specific purpose and configures the user environment to the current X.Org (X11) or Wayland based manager, thus allowing access to GUI applications when run through cuckoo. Note on GUI software and Web Browsers Complete compatibility with both X11 and Wayland based environments has been implemented. Because of the specific Linux architecture and namespaces, some applications may need to specify the graphical environment in order to start and use the currently selected window manager on an X.Org (X11) or Wayland based habitat. Cuckoo can automatically do this by “injecting” predefined options to some preset applications, in particular those based on the chromium engines, most of them being web browsers. To see the list of predefined applications, please start cuckoo with --list-preset-apps option. When running an application with cuckoo, the user should make sure to actually start a new instance. This is usually granted by starting an application from the command line (such as running it with cuckoo). By starting an application from the desktop environment this may not happen. Download AirVPN Suite 2.0.0 The Suite is available in various flavors: ARM 64 bit, ARM 64 bit legacy, ARM 32 bit, ARM 32 bit legacy, x86-64 and x86-64 legacy.

<description>Hello! We're sorry to inform you that due to sloppy support by the datacenter provider (Racklot) we have decommissioned the server Metallah. Metallah went down on June the 18th, 2025, because IP addresses were null-routed. After more than a month, in spite of various contacts and solicitations, Racklot still fails to restore the routing. Our patience is over and we're acting accordingly. This was the last server still not supporting IPv6 (again for the laziness and the sloppy behavior of Racklot), so we finally have IPv6 support on every and each server. Kind regards</description>

<description>Hello! Today we're starting AirVPN 15th Birthday celebrations with big discounts on longer term plans. From a two servers service located in a single country providing a handful of Mbit/s, the baby has grown up to a wide infrastructure in 23 countries on four continents! AirVPN is now one of the few major consumer VPNs that is still independent. In other words, it is not owned by large corporations with diverse interests that interfere through editorial publications or conflict with privacy protection. Since our 14th birthday celebration, our customer base has grown impressively, and we would like to thank all the old and new customers who chose or confirmed AirVPN. AirVPN has focused on comprehensive enhancements, including: line and server expansion to accommodate the outstanding customer growth. The infrastructure can now deliver up to 970,000 Mbit/s. Compared to the 694,000 Mbit/s available in May 2024, this is a 39.7% increase in a single year yet another thorough rewrite of remote inbound port forwarding logic to offer greater convenience and true scalability. The new implementation was designed to meet the growing demand for remote inbound port forwarding the unlimited traffic quota for every and each customer subscription plan has never been modified On the software side: all AirVPN applications and libraries are free and open source software released under GPLv3 new, greatly improved Eddie Desktop and Eddie Android editions Eddie Android edition implements a new community request: an opt-in GPS spoofing feature integrated with the infrastructure in order to provide coordinates consistent with the location of the VPN server the device is connected to Eddie Desktop edition new version included several bug fixes and the new CLI edition is built on .NET7. Thus, it no longer needs Mono (Linux, macOS) and is built without Xamarin (macOS) the development of traffic splitting features on an application basis, already available in AirVPN Eddie Android and Android TV edition, and implemented on the AirVPN Suite for Linux last year, has been improved together with the new Suite features during the year long internal and community tests the OpenVPN3-AirVPN library is actively maintained as usual. If you're already our customer and you wish to extend your stay, any additional subscription will be added to your existing subscriptions and you won't lose any days. Check the promotional prices here: https://airvpn.org/buy Promotion will end on June the 12th, 2025 (UTC). Kind regards and datalove AirVPN Staff ﻿</description>

<![CDATA[ Eddie 2.24.6 Desktop Edition released Hello! We're very glad to inform you that a new stable release of Eddie is now available for Linux (various ARM based architectures included, making it compatible with several Raspberry Pi systems), macOS, Windows. Special thanks to all the beta testers, whose invaluable contributions and suggestions in the last months have helped developers fix several bugs and improve the overall stability of the software. Eddie is a free and open source (GPLv3) OpenVPN GUI and CLI by AirVPN with many additional features such as: traffic leaks prevention via packet filtering rules DNS handling optional connections over Tor or a generic proxy customizable events traffic splitting on a destination IP address or host name basis complete and swift integration with AirVPN infrastructure with OpenVPN and WireGuard white and black lists of VPN servers ability to support IPv4, IPv6 and IPv6 over IPv4 What's new in Eddie 2.24.6 WireGuard is the new communication protocol by default, while OpenVPN remains available for any necessity CPU usage optimization update of packaged binaries and libraries new options to customize WireGuard improved management and configuration of bootstrap servers (qualified domain names are now possible too) systemd-resolved (Linux) enhanced compatibility for all working modes improved management of SIGTERM signal several bug fixes Operating and architectural notes Eddie GUI and CLI run with normal user privileges, while a "backend" binary, which communicates to the user interface with authentication, gains root/administrator privileges, with important security safeguards in place: strict parsing is enforced before passing a profile to OpenVPN in order to block insecure OpenVPN directives external system binaries which need superuser privileges (examples: openvpn, iptables, hummingbird) will not be launched if they do not belong to a superuser Eddie events are not run with superuser privileges: instead of trusting blindly user's responsibility and care when dealing with events, the user is required to explicitly operate to run something with high privileges, if strictly necessary Backend binary is written in C++ on all systems (Windows included), making the whole application faster. Settings, certificates and keys of your account stored on your mass storage can optionally be encrypted on all systems either with a Master Password or in a system key-chain if available.
